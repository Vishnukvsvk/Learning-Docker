rpm -q docker-ce
systemctl enable docker --> Runs after every boot
docker info

provisioning --> installing and booting
4 methods
1)bare metal
2)Cloud Instance
3)Virtualization
4)Docker

docker images --> images downloaded in system
every docker image has unique id

Docker images can launch with 10-20 mb ram

When u launch os in docker, docker commands wont work in that os beacusse u havent installed in it

Docker host == redhat8(In our case)

exit --> to shutdown the os(Not terminate)
docker ps -a --> Info about start and stop of os
To start os again, docker start id(or  name)
After starting, u have to attach to use it
docker attach id(name)

To stop os:
  If u are inside od --> exit
  If u are outside[in new terminal] --> docker stop (name or id)

docker run -it --name vishnuos centos:7  --> Giving instance custom name
If u want to configre server for web or hadoop, gives names according to it. It makes to easy to identify[name should be unique]

redhat and centos are same.[centos is downstream project of redhat],[centos is free,publicly available]

In linux, every command is a file. So if any command doesnt work in docker image,the software isnt installed

Data in docker is temporary.If u save file in one dockerid, it is available there only
If u run --> docker run -it centos:7, it launches docker container with another id.But if u start the previous docker, the data is present

To terminate docker container, use : docker rm (id)

yum install firefox
yum remove firefox

Myth: Cant launch GUI program in docker

docker rmi centos:latest -f

Management commands:
If u are doing anything with containers,add container in command.
docker container run -it centos:7
docker container stop (id)
docker container ps (or) docker container ls
docker images --> docker image ls
docker image rmi ubuntu:14.04

docker image --help  --> for more info

docker container ls -a -q --> gives all ids of containers
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -a -q) --> removes all containers

ctrl+p+q  -->detach from container[comeout of container to main os, but container is still running]

docker run -it centos:7 date  --> after booting,runs date command and then stops
In above command, we can specify a particular program at end.After completing the program,it stops.
The progeam can be ml model,hadoop etc

docker run -it --name os1 --rm centos:7 date  --> Launches,runs program,terminates.

Creating own image:- 1)Commit 2)Dockerfile
docker commit containerid  mycustomimage:v1 --> cloning process
