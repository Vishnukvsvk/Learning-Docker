Docker networking

rhel has a network card --> enp0s3
docker network card --> docker0

if u enable NAT in networking setting of rhel8 vm, u can ping to cmd from rhel, but u cant ping to rhel8 from cmd

if u enable bridge in networking setting of rhel8 vm, both cmd and rhel are pinggable from both sides.

docker0 is network card of docker.It has bridge driver.Docker container can ping to rhel8 terminal and also rhel8 can ping to docker container.But docker container cant ping to cmd.

route -n --> gives route table i.e., gateway info

sysctl -a | grep ip_forward
if ip_forward = 1 , u are connectied to outside world

To connect outside world to docker container, u have to give port while launching docker container
docker run -it -p 1234:80 web_server:1
docker ps -a
We get 0.0.0.0:1234 -> 80, that means 192.168.43.54:1234 , so outside world can access container.
That means , if we can connect to 192.168.43.54(enp0s3), we can connect to container using 1234
192.168.43.54:1234 -> (containerid):80
The above concept is called PAT[PAT is inside of NAT]
This is done by iptables, conecpt is called forwarding
By default,iptables forwarding policy is DROP
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT  --> Changing the policy

Go to chrome and type 192.168.43.54:1234, u will get coonected[u can see site]

---> Docker is a brick and Kubernetes in building

Storage:-
1)ephemeral -- temporary --> C-Drive, if windows stuck and we boot it again,C -drive info is gone,but not D-rive or E-Drive info.
Ephemeral disks are virtual disks that are created for the sole purpose of booting a virtual machine and should be thought of as temporary.
2)Persistent -- permanent

Docker uses ephemeral storage

aias --> temporary command storage --> Type it to see all ali as commands
alias ddel='docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)'
If we type ddel in bash, it executes above command. It works until terminal is closed
To make it permanent, copy that to /root/.bashrc

docker volume create myst1 --> Creates a storage like pendrive
docker run -it --name os1 -v myst1:/var/www/html web_server:1   ===> mounting storage to folder.
--> -v = volume

Volume is just like pendrive. U can store files in one container,terminate the container,and attach the same volume to another container,U can see files of previous container here.Just like pendrive

U can mount the volume to two or more containers

**Volumes should be used in Load Balancing concept.If we update a webserver in its storage,the other server wont get updated.For updating both,we need to attach volumes.
This is called persistent storages.

docker volume inspect mystl --> Gives where is storage taken from in os.

U can even mount baseOS folders to containers
docker run -it -v /run/media/root/RHEL-8-0-0-BaseOS-x86_64:/dvd centos:latest
The above command links all softwares in baseOS to /dvd in container.
In centos container,yum is already configured which has internet url
rm -f *.repo --> To remove all repos in /etc/yum.repos.d folder of container
Create repo which has url of /dvd folder.
By this,it installs from software present in /dvd.

**While mounting software folder of baseos to container, make sure container image version is same of that base OS version

In real world, we give storages like s3,clusters etc
