docker logs (container-name=CN)--> Gives all the things u have done in that container.(All history)
docker logs -f (container-name) --> Gives output at realtime,that is prints continuosly

Devops tool -- Ansible -- Used for automation -- Industry standard

Automation wont work if human intervention takes place in our script

docker exec (CN) date
Only works if container is running in background
goes inside container,runs command and prints output on host

While attching container, if we exit, the container stops
docker exec -it (CN) bash
Using above command we can go into containeer and if we exit,container doesnt stop

docker container -it -d centos:7 --> [-d = detach] --> launch os and runs in background

DHCP --> Allocates dynamic ip to systems
Router connects LAN to internet

docker network inspect bridge
-->Driver = bridge -->Router + Switch

When u launch a container, it launches in bridge network

U can create your owm network.
If u use bridge in your network,DHCP is already configured
docker network create --help

docker network create --driver bridge net1
docker run -dit --name os1 --network net1 centos:7

In your own network, u can ping between two containers using therir name.
Always connect servers using name and not ip address because ip may change when we restart 
Linking of containers is only possible in our network,not in default bridge network

null deiver doesnt have network card, so no net connectivity
So if u launch container in none(null driver), its isolated i.e., no net connection
This container is used for testing purpose

docker network disconnect net1 c1 --> diconnecting from network (or) remove NIC
docker network connect net2 c1

Lad Balancing: Many algorithms
1)Round Robin --> 1st request to 1st server,2nd to 2nd, 3rd to 1st,4th to 2nd ... like that


To enable httpd,
vi /root/.bashrc
rm -rf /var/run/httpd/*
/usr/sbin/httpd

There are many hardware/softwares for load balancing
DNS also does load balancing

Crete two servers using our image in our network.
Now create client and ping to its dns name
U will see load-balancing effect
** Client should be in same network.[Try creating client in our network and in default network]
docker container run -it --name web1 --network-alias sitename --network mynet webphp:v1
