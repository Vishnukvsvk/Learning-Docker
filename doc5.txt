Vitualization
-->In this concept, the os shares ram,storage of the main hardware.
-->It thinks it as a whole computer
-->Lot of wastage of resources in thi concept
-->Too heavy

Docker
-->It is a container
-->It shares both hardware and kernel of base OS.
Kernel is a software which is a bridge between hardware and applications in os.It is huge.
For booting os, kernel is necessary.It scans the devices and locates all the necessary drivers and starts it.

When u r inside container,
rpm -q kernel --> u get kernel is not intsalled
uname -r --> gives the kernel using.
In container,without installing kernel, we can use it by sharing kernel of base OS.
Also container uses RAM exactly the RAM of base OS.

The main reason docker is fast is there is no booting.Every resource is shared.

In any linux os, first process they start is systemd --> before versions,it was init
pstree --> commnad shows the linkage of all process
systemd starts  other proces and those start other process.
systemctl is inside systemd process

In container,there is no systemd process


Ip address --> Private and Public
Private address range: // Free of cost

24-bit block ---> 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255  --> used in cloud computing
20-bit block ---> 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 --> Used by docker
16-bit block ---> 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

ISP Rule
Private ip can ping Private ip only
Public ip can ping Public ip only

Router has two Nic with two ips
One end is private ip in LAN range, Other end is public ip
When we send packect,It contains source & destination ip.
Router receives and changes source ip to its public ip so that ISP cant block
This is called SNAT --> Source Network Address Translation

SNAT --> Private to Public
DNAT --> Public to Private  , D = Destination

By default,Router disables DNAT, u can enable it.

Rhel in VMBox can ping to windows as it thinks windows ip as public
But windows cant ping to rhel as it thinks it as private network

If u launch container in host network, network card of host is shared to container.
If u launch container in bridge network,a new network card is created in container.
